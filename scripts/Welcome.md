# Welcome to your new HyperGame Instance ðŸš€

Thank you for your patience, your HyperGame Instance is up and running.
If you can't find Steam, Chrome or Parsec on your desktop, the host was pretty fast setting up your VM.
Fear not, wait a few more minutes and they should show up.

Please make use of the attached extra hard drive and configure your game library (such as Steam) to check for games there, too.
Some games are already preloaded into this (differencial) disk, to save some storage on the host system.
